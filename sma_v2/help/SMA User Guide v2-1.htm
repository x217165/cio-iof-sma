<P>The User Group is made up of the Super Users identified in the SMA Process Ownership Model plus additional representatives from the IT department who represent systems that may be affected by the proposed changes. </P>

<P>The role of the Super User is to represent their peer group in the ownership of process, function and data for their area of responsibility.    Super user responsibilities include:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Identify and collect ideas for improvements from peer users. </LI>
<LI>Analyze the impact of the improvement with regards to their function(s).</LI>
<LI>Responsibly escalate improvement ideas and issues that overlap functional boundaries with the User Group for discussion.</LI>
<LI>Participate in issue resolution to ensure the needs of the <B>entire &quot;Service Management&quot; process</B> are met.  </LI>
<LI>Update User Procedures document to reflect changes.</LI>
<LI>Disseminate new and changed information to their peer group.</LI></OL>


<P>The role of the User Group Meeting is to serve as a forum where all issues regarding any process, data or system function can be shared with the other Super Users and IT representatives.  The purpose is to fully understand the implications that a change or addition may have on other groups in the process.  The primary responsibility of the User Group Meeting is to:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Review and prioritize improvement ideas raised by Super Users since the previous meeting. </LI>
<LI>Resolve issues that affect more than one functional area.</LI>
<LI>Ensure system change requests are logged in the C3S program</LI>

<P>Each Super User is responsible for issue resolution and maintenance of documentation within their functional areas.  </P>

<P>Any change relating to DATA, PROCESS or SYSTEM should follow the following process:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Conduct a preliminary analysis of the change request.  </LI>
<P>Ensure the change request is valid and that it cannot be solved with training.   If the change request is valid, identify the groups that may be affected by the change.  Get input from the identified Super Users regarding the potential impact of the change request.</P>
<LI>Log the change request as an item on the user group meeting agenda.</LI>
<P>E-mail a note to the User Group Coordinator (currently Lee Ettinger).  The note should contain a short description of the issue and an estimate of the amount of time it will take to fully discuss the issue in the meeting.  Try to be realistic in your time estimate so that the meeting can be planned to cover all items.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> </P>
<P>AT THE USER GROUP MEETING</P>

<LI>Review and Discuss items on the agenda.  The Super User responsible for logging the item should give background information on the change request for the rest of the user group. </LI>
<LI>If it is determined by the user group that the change request is required and valuable continue with step 5, otherwise the issue should be closed and the Super User responsible for logging the item should communicate the resolution to the original requestor.</LI>
<LI>If the change request results in enhancements or changes to the system, log the change request in the C3S application.</LI>
<LI>If the change request results in process or data changes, each Super User is responsible to update the new process in the Procedures Document and also to communicate the new procedures to their peer user group.</LI></OL>

</I><P>There are often many contacts for each customer, and each contact can have one or multiple roles assigned to them. The important thing to remember is that these contacts, in the database are used by Remedy T2 and C2, and by Operations to provide contact information when alarms are detected on TAC equipment located at their sites. These automatic alarms create Remedy T2 tickets, which will have customer contact information attached.</P>

<P>By default, Remedy will attach the SITE1 contact to any automatic (Spectrum created) trouble ticket on any specific element. This will only happen if a customer contact is defined as a SITE contact and the specific element is linked to that site location and customer in the SMA Managed Objects. Otherwise, if no site contact is available, the PRIM1 will be attached. If neither a SITE1 nor PRIM1 is defined for the customer, the contact information in the ticket will be blank. However, all contacts can be queried via the pull down menu on the ticket. The SERV1 contact is only used for E-Mail notification.</P>

<P>It is valuable to have site contacts when the OSC requires confirmation of power and physical connectivity, as in most cases, the tickets are created by the systems and not called in by the customer. In cases where we have customers that want a single point of contact from a networking perspective, then SITE contacts should not be defined, and the PRIME1 should be the customer helpdesk or main technical contact (7x24). </P>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc478810440"><I>E-Mail Contact</A></LI></OL>
</OL>
</OL>
</OL>

</I><P>Contact information is also used by Operations when sending email notification to customers for upcoming maintenance window activity that will affect their service, and for customer notifications and updates when a global outage occurs that affects multiple customers and services.</P>

<P>From both C2 and T2, an email distribution can be created for the customers that are linked to the service tags on any change ticket or trouble ticket. As a result of service correlation, any element that has a change or trouble ticket can have an email distribution list created for quick and easy notification. Obviously, this is only possible if the customer contacts are defined properly in the ESD and their correct email addresses are also entered.</P>

<P>Email notification (for all customer services) will be sent to the following customer roles:</P>
<OL>

<LI>PRIM1 (Helpdesk- email should be the helpdesk email or an email that distributes to multiple contacts within the organization).</LI>
<LI>PRIM2 (Manager or Lead Communication Analyst)</LI>
<LI>SERV1 (Technical contact for a specific service i.e. Web Hosting).</LI></OL>


<P>The only time a SERV1 contact needs to be defined is if a specific customer has multiple services, and for some of these services they would like a different person contacted. We find this to be the case when a customer has purchased both Internetworking and Internet Hosting services. Often the customer’s organization is such that different people are responsible for the LAN/WAN and the Hosting Services.</P>

<LI><A NAME="_Toc478810441"><I>Change Control</A></LI>
</I><P>Another Role is the CHANGE role. This is used by operations to confirm that a specific customer contact has the authority to request changes to an existing service. The customer change process allows a customer to request a change by emailing the OSC with the details. This email must be received from an authorized change requestor for that customer. So, if a customer is going to be requesting changes, the contacts that are authorized must have CHANGE roles assigned in the ESD.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The facility Detail screen has different criteria for each facility type, i.e. ADSL, FIBRE, FR, etc.  </P>
<P>A circuit is a &quot;physical&quot; path on the network on which electronic data can travel from one point to another.  While a network connection is a &quot;logical&quot; connection between two service locations, it is &quot;physically&quot; built as one or more circuits.  It is crucial to accurately measure/monitor traffic on every circuit because this is the source of all customer usage calculations required for billing.  Currently the following circuits types have been identified: ATM, Fibre, Frame Relay, xDSL and ISDN.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<B><P>Fields</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>:</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> </P>

<B><P>Ownership Status</B> - The majority of assets are "Owned&quot;, or else they belong to a customer and TAC is simply managing them ("Not TAC").</P>

<B><P>Deployment Status</B> - Initially set to "Pending" by the Receiver, the Installer will reset this status once the asset has been put into service.  All assets that are part of the managed network should be set to "Manageable by OSC".  Other assets would be "Assigned" unless they are a &quot;Maintenance Spare".  Any of the other statuses will indicate that the asset is no longer an active asset within the company.</P>

<B><P>Department </B>– Select from drop-down box, i.e. Engineering and Operations - All items ("real" and "virtual") that are part of the configuration of a service for a customer – their make and model and their physical location.  Provides an inventory of items in service with their locations, for network and configuration planning.  All items ("real" and "virtual") that can be alarmed for automated trouble ticketing – their location and customer that the asset is being used for.  These assets do not need to be owned by TAC as we manage equipment on behalf of customers.  By linking network alarm sources to assets information regarding affected services and customers can be gleaned and the appropriate people contacted regarding current or potential problems.  Managed Services - All items that we own, manage or purchase on behalf of Outsourcing clients.  Provides detailed information regarding activities undertaken on behalf of outsourcing clients.</P>

<B><P>Requestor/Custodian</B> – Must use look-up Contact Search for selection.</P>

<B><P>Purchase Order</B> - Purchase order field required.</P>

<B><P>Asset Type</B> - When selecting this item, check the asset sub-class information that is displayed to ensure that the asset type does map to the sub-class you would expect. Asset ID, Asset sub-class, and Class – Fields will be automatically filled when Asset Type selection made.</P>

<B><P>Make/Model/Part</B> – Must use look-up to Asset Catalogue Search.</P>

<B><P>Serial #</B> - Enter number from equipment.</P>

<B><P>Comments</B> – Any additional information concerning this asset.</P>

<B><P>Vendor </B>– Select from drop-down box company that equipment is purchased from. </P>

<B><P>Bar Code</B> - record the bar code that could be placed on the asset </P>

<B><P>Asset Serial Number</B> - Serial number is a required field and should only be set to "Unknown" in situations where it is genuinely difficult to determine the serial number (e.g. part is already installed deep within some other asset).</P>

<B><P>Unique TAC Names</B> - are formatted using standards developed by Engineering and Operations.  This name must match the one used in the network monitoring software to tie alerts together.</P>

<B><P>SAP Asset Management Record#</B> and associated <B>SAP Capitalization Date</B> - are the indication to the system that this asset should be reconcilable to SAP Asset Management module and therefore should be included in all Reconciliation reporting.</P>

<P>A number of the fields on this screen are mandatory for assets that are &quot;grouped&quot; in SAP.  Many of the fields are currently disabled for assets that are held individually in SAP (no need to hold the data in two places).  For SAP &quot;pooled&quot; assets, entry is optional.</P>

<P>The additional asset dollar entry fields are used to capture information about costs that are attributable to the asset but are over and above the direct purchase price.</P>

<B><P>Maintenance section</B> - provides free format fields to hold maintenance scheduling and version number information.</P>

<B><P>Cloning</B> - From the asset add/edit screen, the currently displayed asset can be used as a template to create a &quot;clone&quot; asset.  The new asset simply uses the field values from the old asset, to facilitate data entry.  There is no permanent relationship between the two records.  When entering a new asset, finding a similar one and cloning it, will be significantly faster than entering all the data from scratch.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>Question - Should the Managed Object be attached to a Customer Service instead of a Service Location?  Currently the user has the ability to attach a managed object to a completely different service than it gets correlated with.  Why is a managed object being linked to a Customer Service here.  Isn’t this really just correlating the managed object in a different place?</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Type </B>– Always ATM-PVC.  </P>
<B>
<P>PVC #/PVC Name </B> - The PVC # is a unique number that references the PVC circuit.  This field is populated with the circuit number from the ATM Network when the circuit is autodiscovered.  The PVC Name will default to be the same as the PVC#, however it may be overwritten should you wish to have a more user-friendly description.</P>

<B><P>PVC Start Date</B> – This is the date that the ATM PVC was autodiscovered.  It is the date that the system can start collecting usage.  The date will be inserted by the circuit discovery process, however it can be overwritten.</P>
<B>
<P>PVC Provider – </B>This is the organization that provisions the circuit.  For ATM PVCs the circuit provider will always be TAC.  The system will default the value to TAC, however the value can be overwritten.</P>

<B><P>Operational Status Code</B> – Drop-down menu used for selection, i.e. UNKNWN – Unknown.   This status is used for ATM PVC circuits only.  A status of UNKNWN is set when the ATM PVC is autodiscovered by the Usage Collection Process.  A circuit that is in ‘UNKNWN’ status will not generate revenue because the usage will not be passed to the billing system.  OPER – Operational.  This status indicates that the PVC has been fully connected.  It is collecting usage for a Customer Service. TERM – Terminated.  This status indicates that the PVC is no longer in use by a Customer Service.  PNDOUT - Pending out of circuit.  SPARE - PVC not in use at this time.  DEFINE - being built in SMA </P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>To attach a network element to a customer service you want to select a managed object from the ‘Available Network Components’ and add it to the ‘Network Component Correlation’.</P>

<P>The Available Network Components are sub-divided into 3 sub-component types.  These are:</P>

<P>Managed Objects Tab – this list contains all managed objects that are in the database and classified as being operational.  To help in finding the managed object in the list, the list can be narrowed by selecting the managed object type from the ‘Type’ dropdown list or entering the first few characters of the Network Element Name (Managed Object Name). </P>

<P>Circuits Tab – this list contains all circuits that are in the database and classified as being operational.  The circuit list contains both facilities (e.g. frame relay, fibre, ISDN, ADSL etc.) and ATM PVCs.  To help in finding the circuit in the list, the list can be narrowed by selecting the circuit type from the ‘Type’ dropdown list or by entering the first few characters of the Circuit Name.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Root Services Tab – A root service is a service that correlates commonly used network elements that are used by a variety of other services.  When a root service is attached or correlated to a Customer Service, the Customer Service automatically inherits the connection to the network elements that are attached to the Root Service.</P>

<P>To ADD a Network Component to the Customer Service (correlate the service), select the Managed Object/Circuit/Root Service from the ‘Available Network Components’ list by clicking it.  Then click on the ‘ADD’ button.  The selected network element should appear in the ‘Network Component Correlation’ list and disappear from the ‘Available Network Components’ list.</P>

<P>To REMOVE a Network Component from a Customer Service, select the component from the ‘Network Component Correlation’ list by clicking on it.  Then click on the ‘Remove’ button.  The selected component should disappear from the ‘Available Network Components’ list and appear back in the ‘Available Network Components’ list.</P>

<P>To VIEW a Network Component, select the Component Name from the ‘Network Component Correlation’ List.  Then click the ‘View Component’ button.  If the selected component is a managed object type, the Managed Object window will open to display the details.  If the selected component is a facility circuit type, the Facilities window will open to display the details, if it is an ATM circuit the PVC Management window will open.  If the selected component is a Root Service, the Customer Service Management window will display. </P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>
<P>There are 3 valid <B>Status Codes</B> for a customer service. </P>
<P>&#9;DESIGN – Implementation Managers are responsible for adding new customer services.  New customer services have a status of design.  A design status indicates that the customer service is not being monitored or supported by the Operations Service Centre (OSC) nor is the customer being invoiced for the service.</P>
<P>&#9;OPERATIONAL – The Operations Service Centre (OSC) is responsible for changing the status of a customer service to operational.  An operational status indicates that the customer is free to use the service, OSC is fully monitoring and supporting the customer service and Customer Care is invoicing the customer for the service.</P>
<P>&#9;TERMINATED – The Operations Service Centre (OSC) is responsible for changing the status of a customer service to terminated.  A terminated status indicates that the customer can no longer access and use the service, OSC is no longer monitoring and supporting the customer service and Customer Care is no longer billing the customer for that service.</P>

<P>To ACTIVATE a customer Service, set the Customer Service Status to ‘Operational’.  The system will automatically set the Date In-Service to the current date.  This date can be overwritten.</P>
<P>To DEACTIVATE a customer service, first remove all network elements that are correlated to the service (see Attaching Network Elements to the Customer Service (Correlation Management) process).  Next set the Customer Service Status to ‘Terminated’.  The system will automatically set the Date Terminated to the current date.  This date can be overwritten.</P>

<B><P>IMPORTANT</B>:  </P>
<P>When a customer service is activated or deactivated, the Customer Service Manager and the Billing Specialist <U>must be informed</U>.  The system will generate an E-mail note.  Verify the recipients of the note and confirm that there is a Customer Service Manager and a Billing Specialist, if not add them to the recipient list.  <B>PRESS THE SEND BUTTON ON THE E-MAIL…DO NOT CANCEL THE E-MAIL MESSAGE.</P>
